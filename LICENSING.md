# FM1_Locus licensing

FM1_Locus is free software, licensed under the GNU General Public License, version 3 only (`GPL-3.0-only`, full
text in `LICENSE`). That covers the firmware, the tools, the web installer and the tests. A few bundled parts keep
their own licences; they are listed below, and their licence texts are in `LICENSES/`.

FM1_Locus is a fork of FM1_AudioBase, a fork of MOOD_FM1 (the FM-1 port of MOOD), itself a copy of GATOR
(Copyright (C) 2026 npi3pak), which is built on the Felucca platform, Copyright (C) 2026 Leo Kuroshita
(@kurogedelic), Hügelton Instruments (GPL-3.0-only), through SLOOP and ORBIT. The files taken from them keep their copyright headers. Its visualizer
(`firmware/apps/locus/avis.c`) is MOOD_FM1's audio visualizer.

You may use, study, change and share FM1_Locus under the GPL. If you distribute it, or firmware derived from it,
you must also give your recipients its complete corresponding source under the same licence.

FM1_Locus is provided without any warranty (GPL-3.0 sections 15 and 16). Installing it is at your own risk.

**Source code.** The complete corresponding source of every released package is the tag `vX.Y` of
<https://github.com/stevexfer/FM1_Locus> (GitHub attaches its archives to the release); the web installer links
the source of the version it installs. `BUILDING.md` describes how to build it.

**Modified files.** Files changed from what they were taken from keep their copyright lines and carry a line per
change: "Modified for GATOR by npi3pak, 2026, from ORBIT 0.6.0", "Modified for MOOD_FM1, 2026: …", "Modified for
FM1_AudioBase, 2026: …", "Modified for FM1_Locus, 2026: …"; the patches to the eurorack code are marked `FM1_Locus` and
listed in `third_party/eurorack/PATCHES.md`. Files without such a line are unchanged (the HAL, and the update loader's code, whose binary
is byte-identical to ORBIT's).

## What is GPL-3.0-only

Every file in this tree that carries an `SPDX-License-Identifier: GPL-3.0-only` header:

- the firmware: `firmware/` (the LOCUS app and the demo app, the system layer, the HAL, the update loader)
- the build scripts and tools: `build.sh`, `tools/` (not `tools/sdk/`, below)
- the web installer and its tests: `web/`
- the host simulator and tests: `host/`

## Platform and third-party material

| What | Licence | Where |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Felucca by Leo Kuroshita, Hügelton Instruments (<https://github.com/hugelton/Felucca>): the HAL, the update loader, USB-MIDI, USB audio, OTA, recovery, flash storage, the `.fwsc` packer and the command-line installer | GPL-3.0-only | `firmware/hal/`, `firmware/loader/`, `firmware/sys/`, `tools/` |
| ORBIT by dspaudio (<https://github.com/dspaudio/orbit>), a fork of SLOOP: the platform GATOR was cut down from | GPL-3.0-only | as above |
| SLOOP by isod89 (<https://github.com/isod89/sloop-fm1>), a fork of Felucca: the web install protocol (`fm1ota.js`, `fm1pkg.js`, unchanged from SLOOP 2.7), the stock supply levels at start | GPL-3.0-only | `web/fm1ota.js`, `web/fm1pkg.js`, `firmware/hal/fm1_sys.h` |
| ChoralRoot by Quixotic7 (<https://github.com/Quixotic7/ChoralRootFM1>): the order of the audio interrupt's acknowledge (0.18); the release and Pages workflows follow its layout | GPL-3.0-only | `firmware/sys/audio.c`, `.github/workflows/` |
| Rings and Clouds (Mutable Instruments) by Emilie Gillet (<https://github.com/pichenettes/eurorack>, commit `08460a69`), and stmlib (commit `d18def81`): the resonator's and the granular processor's DSP, patched (`third_party/eurorack/PATCHES.md`) | MIT | `third_party/eurorack/`, `LICENSES/MIT-Emilie-Gillet.txt` |
| Terminus font by Dimitar Toshkov Zhekov: the UI text, rasterised into the firmware at build time (`tools/gen_font.py`) | SIL OFL 1.1 | `assets/fonts/ter-u16n.bdf`, `LICENSES/OFL-Terminus.txt` |
| JieLi AC79 SDK by JieLi Technology: three of its files go into every `.fwsc` package (below) | Apache-2.0 | `tools/sdk/`, `LICENSES/Apache-2.0-JieLi-SDK.txt` |

## JieLi SDK files in the packages (Apache-2.0)

A `.fwsc` package made by `tools/build.py` holds three unmodified files from the JieLi AC79 SDK, tag
`AC79NN_SDK_V1.2.1_2023-12-13` (<https://gitee.com/Jieli-Tech/fw-AC79_AIoT_SDK>, `cpu/wl82/tools/`), vendored in
`tools/sdk/` with the SDK's licence:

| File in the package | What it is |
| --- | --- |
| `uboot.boot` | the first-stage boot loader (SPL) |
| `cfg_tool.bin` | the chip configuration block |
| `eq_cfg_hw.bin` | the default hardware EQ table |

They are licensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0, not under the GPL, and their copyright stays with JieLi
Technology. The SDK has no NOTICE file. Every distribution of a package carries the licence texts with it: the
release (`tools/release.py`) and the site (`web/make_site.py`, next to the packages in `firmware/`).

## No vendor material

No M-VAVE material is part of FM1_Locus. The firmware links no vendor code and contains no vendor data. The web
installer's "Back to the official firmware" holds only the official file's size and SHA-256: you select the file you
downloaded from M-VAVE yourself, and it is checked and installed in your browser, never uploaded or redistributed.

## Trademarks

"M-VAVE" and "FM-1" are trademarks of their respective owners. FM1_Locus is independent firmware that runs on
FM-1 hardware; it is not affiliated with, endorsed by or supported by them. It names itself "LOCUS FM-1" on USB so that
the computer and the installers recognise the device. "Mutable Instruments", "Rings" and "Clouds" are Emilie Gillet's:
the firmware uses her MIT-licensed code under its own names (RESONATOR, LOCUS) and is not affiliated with or endorsed
by Mutable Instruments.

## Contributions

Contributions are welcome under GPL-3.0-only.
